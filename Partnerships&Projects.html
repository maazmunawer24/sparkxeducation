            <p>We the team of Spark X before going into the market, before aiming towards schools and 
              institutes we thought that why not we do a test run for our courses. The very first project
               that we started was at our main office. The CEO of our organization by himself wanted to see the results that:
                Are the students really interested in learning Modern I.T education? Are they really willing to go beyond their 
                curriculum studies? So for acquiring those answers the CEO of our Organization himself started providing 
                services to the students and we were very glad to see the results that students these days want to 
                learn more about I.T and digitalization, 
              students are willing to adapt the change that the whole World is experiencing.</p>

              <h1>Al-EMAN Education System</h1><br>
              <p>
                After completing our first Pilot Project successfully we headed towards the Schools with full preparation.
                We approached many schools at that point of time and were successful to get a project in “Al-Eman Education System”. 
                The owner of Al –Eman welcomed us and gave us a chance which was very crucial for us at that time. He believed in us and
                provided us with the opportunity for which we have been looking for. Our main aim is to target schools so that each and
                every child can get the relevant and upgraded I.T knowledge that must be provided on that particular level.
                The faculty was very kind with our members and the students were well disciplined and showed great interest.
                We have seen the thirst for knowledge in the students they were quick learners as well so it was not a difficult task to 
                train them.

                    <p>
                      We continued our journey and found a very prestigious institute, “Sir Naseem Institute” to carry forward 
                      our work there. We had several meetings with the Head of the Institute who was very inspired by our ideas
                       and the confidence which he saw in us. At that point of time we thought that what would be the result and 
                       what would be the consequences if we try to teach students that are pursuing for Professional Studies. 
                       We taught students of Matric and Inter Board also in the same institute. It was a good experience working
                        with “SNI” it’s a very reputable and well known institute. 
                      We surely will approach them soon again and will be delighted to serve our services there.
